# Gambling FPGAs

## Intro

This GitHub repo contains all code required and produced by the Gambling FPGAs team for the Information Processing coursework, made as part of a second year remote group project in the spring term of the 2020-21 academic year. This project involved 6 members with the objective of designing the software and hardware requried to create an online multiplayer poker game, where each player interacted with the game through the use of an FPGA based controller.

Each player would securely log into their account both on the website and on a program running on their computer and then use the FPGA to control the game. Controls included buttons to bet aswell as actions such as tilting the FPGA up to display your cards.
