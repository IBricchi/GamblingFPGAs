## web-server

The web side of the server is very simple, it's just a static website hosted on (GamblingFPGAs)[ibricchi.com/projects/live/gambling_fpgas]

Changes made here are not directly reflected. Please let me, Ignacio, know if you've made any changes and I can update the src of the website.

Before developing make sure to run ./setup.sh to dowload necessary javascript libraries, this is just for better autocompletion with vscode.
